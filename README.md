# Globalist
Idea: distributed githubless repository sharing. Yes, this is the official home ;-)

Globalist is an attempt to ease the distribution of git repos, away from central points of failure.

Globalist stands for "Global List" and aims at replacing any EtherPads of more than transient value.

Globalist is also an experiment at creating a distributed asynchronous wiki facility, for example when the central wiki of a conference succumbs to a DDos on the 0th day ;-)

Nodes can come and go, and network topology only depends on the peers entries in the nodes' config files. Changes that are merged by one's peers propagate by diffusion.
